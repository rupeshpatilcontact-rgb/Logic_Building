🧠 Logic Building Assignments
📘 About the Repository
This repository contains a series of logic-building assignments developed using C, C++, and Java.
It is designed to enhance:

🧠 Problem-solving skills
🧩 Algorithmic thinking
💡 Programming foundation for interviews, competitive coding, and academics
Each assignment includes hand-written programs solving real-world logic problems like number patterns, recursion, arrays, strings, and more.
